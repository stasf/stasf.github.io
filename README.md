## Limitations
- Used default media player for the [Play] button, which makes it appear inconsistent across different browsers. This limitation can be solved by creating art for my own buttons with the same functionality as the built-in <audio> tag

## Usability
- Preview sounds on the home page by clicking the Play button beside the sample name
- Click the checkbox beside the samples you like
- Click checkout to go to the next page
- Go back to the homepage if you want to change your selection
